    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a group of `m` blue balls and `n` red balls, making a total of `m + n` balls. We want to choose `k` balls from this collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how many ways we can choose `k` balls, we can break down the selection based on how many red balls we pick. Let's say we pick `j` red balls. Since there are `n` red balls, the number of ways to choose `j` red balls is given by  (  binom n  j   ).\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, since we can choose any value of `j` from `0` to `k`, we sum over all possible choices of `j`. Thus, the total number of ways to choose `k` balls, consisting of `j` red balls and `k - j` blue balls, is given by:\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we simply want to know how many ways we can choose `k` balls from `m + n` balls (without regard to color), the total number of ways to do that is:\n",
